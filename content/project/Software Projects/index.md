This project aimed at enhancing decision-making in League of Legends (a multiplayer online battle arena video game), we analyzed data from 2,268 game matches to assist users in selecting their optimal final hero and predicting the lineup of both teams to estimate their chances of winning. The project involved preprocessing over one million data points from CSV and JSON files using techniques such as normalization, standardization, one-hot encoding, and classification, employing R and python for these tasks. I leveraged Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) theory to construct a discriminate model to identify true and "fake" data from the generate model, optimizing the model's loss rate using TensorFlow and Keras. Additionally, I contributed to building a regression neural network for predicting win probabilities and developed an interactive web interface using HTML and JavaScript. The prediction accuracy of the final model can be reached 37%.
