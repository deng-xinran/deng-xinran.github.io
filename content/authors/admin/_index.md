#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am an AI researcher and engineer with hands-on experience in developing machine learning pipelines for computer vision and 3D point cloud processing. My recent work involves building Python-based tools using OpenCV, scikit-learn, and deep learning frameworks to extract structural features and optimize data workflows. Iâ€™m passionate about bridging AI theory with practical applications, and I enjoy solving real-world problems through predictive modeling and generative techniques.

With a background in industrial visual inspection and academic research, Iâ€™m actively seeking AI-focused roles where I can contribute to model development, data processing, and prototyping of innovative solutions. I also explore side projects involving front-end tools to stay creative and full-stack aware.
