#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of machine learning, trustworthy AI, and LLM-based agent systems. My work focuses on developing reliable and efficient AI models with practical deployment in mind—bridging the gap between research and real-world applications.
I have experience in designing and optimizing deep learning pipelines for computer vision, 3D point cloud processing, and data-driven decision systems. Recently, my research explores how information-theoretic perspectives can improve privacy and robustness in large models while maintaining performance. I am particularly interested in understanding and building autonomous, safe, and verifiable AI agents.
