The most accurate pronunciation of my name is Dèng syīn rán in Mandarin or Dahng Haan-Yin in Cantonese, but I wouldn’t mind if you call me Hsin-Ran, Sheen-Ran, or simply “XR.” In Chinese naming conventions, the surname precedes the given name, so “Deng” is my family name, and “Xinran” is my given name. In publications, however, I follow the Western convention and list my name as Xinran Deng.

Chinese names often carry profound meanings. “Deng” (邓 in simplified Chinese, 鄧 in traditional Chinese) is my surname, and it is the 28th most common surname in mainland China. In Cantonese, it is pronounced as Dahng. The surname originated from the ancient Deng State during the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, which later became part of the Chu State. It reflects a legacy deeply rooted in Chinese history and culture.

My given name, “Xinran”, combines two characters:

欣 (Xīn in Mandarin, Haan in Cantonese): meaning “delight” or “happiness,” symbolizing joy and positivity.

然 (Rán in Mandarin, Yin in Cantonese): meaning “in this way” or “naturally,” implying authenticity and being true to oneself.

Together, “Xinran” embodies the idea of approaching life with genuine delight and optimism. The name reflects my desire to inspire others with warmth and positivity, bringing light to the lives of those around me.
